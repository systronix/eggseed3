# iotaseed
A pure client-side IOTA seed generator!

The code behind http://iotaseed.io/.

**NOTE: This is a scam! This code is forked here for historical and analytical purposes only!
See [this ZDnet article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/europol-arrests-uk-man-for-stealing-eur10-million-worth-of-iota-cryptocurrency/) and [this code analysis by Alex Studer](https://thatoddmailbox.github.io/2018/01/28/iotaseed.html). Also this scam is one of several mentioned in [this Ars Technica Article](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/two-new-cryptocurrency-heists-make-off-with-over-400m-worth-of-blockchange/)** The scammer's GitHub account is gone, the source of this fork was not part of the scam.

Should also work locally. Both through 'Save Page As', and when checked
out from the git repo. Though when using it for real, please stick to
the stable version from the site.

It is secure, using random data from the mouse and other entropy such
as current time, to generate an IOTA seed.

It also provides 36 mnemonic words (35 + 1 parity) to represent the
seed, that can be used to recover the seed at all times.

All of these are then represented in a paper wallet that can be
printed off for easy safe-keeping. Now also supports bulk seed 
generating, providing 12 paper wallets in one go.

The mnemonic words are those in the standard BIP32 list.

The interesting bits of code are inside jscript/iotaseed.js and iotawallet.js

Libraries used are:

* BigInteger (for Mnemonic words, http://peterolson.github.io/BigInteger.js/)
* clipboard (for copy to clipboard, https://clipboardjs.com/)
* entropy-collector (for mouse entropy, https://github.com/vibornoff/entropy-collector.js)
* notifier (for UI notifications, http://rlemon.github.io/Notifier.js/)
* seedrandom (for seeding with entropy, https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom)

And for the paper wallet generator (inspired by Aran Cauchi's
https://github.com/arancauchi/IOTA-Paper-Wallet)

* iota.lib.js (for receive address, https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.js)
* qrious (for wallet QR codes, https://github.com/neocotic/qrious)

for scammers to take the code and to modify it in inappropriate ways.
